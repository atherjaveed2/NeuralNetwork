**Question 1.** 
Implement Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library Use dataset available with name 
glass and Use train_test_split to create training and testing part Evaluate the model on test 
part using score and classification_report(y_true, y_pred).


**Question 2.** 
Implement linear SVM method using scikit library Use the same dataset above
Use train_test_split to create training and testing part Evaluate the model on test part using 
score and classification_report(y_true, y_pred).


**Answer.** 
For both questions the code is written using the inbuilt library functions of pandas and scikit-learn of python and for referece I have added the comments in the code itself.

**Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?**
Cleary we can see that Naive Bayes algorithm has better accuracy than the SVM method. Naive Bayes classifiers have been observed to achieve higher accuracy compared to other algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM). This is because Naive Bayes makes a simplifying assumption of feature independence, allowing it to effectively model the data when this assumption holds true. Additionally, Naive Bayes is computationally efficient and requires fewer parameters to tune, making it particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized datasets. Therefore, in cases where the data aligns well with the assumptions of Naive Bayes and computational efficiency is a priority, Naive Bayes may outperform other algorithms, including SVM, in terms of accuracy.
